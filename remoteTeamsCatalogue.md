# The nuances of onsite, offshore & remote teams

In the wake of COVID-19, there’s been a huge focus on remote working best practices. I imagine there are teams out there to whom remote work is a brand new world and as a consultant, I can guess the types of things they are struggling with and googling for solutions on.

There are also teams out there, who have always been working in a remote fashion and are probably wondering why there are now 101 articles on remote working and what all the fuss is about. It’s easy - right?

Except like having agility, remote work is not easy and more importantly there is no one correct way of doing it. 

What works for a team that’s been remote from day one may be super hard to adopt into a ‘suddenly-remote’ team and vice versa. There are many patterns that are suitable in different contexts, and some combinations of those patterns work well and some work less well.

So far, I have seen a lot of articles that lack decent concrete, real world experiences of remote teams so their nuances, at best they are confusing and at worst the conclusions tend to be somewhat generic and unhelpful. 
This is why I have decided to note down, my rather opinionated collection of observations of the patterns of remote working I have seen over my 17 year career in tech.

Note : Most articles seem to have forgotten that remote working also includes near-shored, off-shored, and out-sourced teams who have been doing this for literally decades. I have decided to include them as they are as much a part of remote culture as anyone else and they have some helpful lessons to learn.

## What works and what doesn’t

### One site internal colocated teams

This, I think, is the assumed to be the most effective pattern you would have experienced in the pre-COVID world. One site, one mission, one hierarchy all in the same melting pot. There is a lot to be said for this model of work. It most likely has the highest of all quality of communication bandwidth. The ability to exchange information with colleagues by walking to another room or floor to is probably the most efficient method. If knowledge work was just about getting features delivered this would be the king. Unfortunately knowledge work is not just about getting features delivered. It’s also about delivering the right features and this is where I think this model is potentially weaker than some of the others.

#### Pros
* Easy access to f2f information - highest quality communication channel
* Highest level of serendipitous events & information swapping (water cooler chats)
* Easiest to create social cohesion & organise people for events and all-hands

#### Cons
* More susceptible to Group think
* Tendency to insular culture which limits workforce diversity
* Often loud & hard to concentrate environment

### Multi site internal colocated teams

This is probably the most common pattern you would have experienced in the pre-COVID corporate world. Many sites, multiple missions, one hierarchy all in locational silo’s.
If organised well, this model can be super powerful. You get the benefits of multiple geographic locations & diversity of culture and employees, with only a small trade-off in communication quality around culture and language differences. If teams and offices are organised in an autonomous way and are aligned then you can experience potentially greater velocity than a single location with the benefits of getting alerted to group think or better chances to building the right things and greater innovation. 
Conversely done badly with heavy dependencies and lack of clarity or accountability between offices, this model can also be a living hell of constantly delayed delivery, in-effective handovers and political in-fighting. 

#### Pros
* High quality communication channel on team level
* High level of inter-team serendipitous events
* Defence against group think and building the wrong things

#### Cons
* Needs strict management & clarity to prevent dependencies & ensure accountability
* Heavy burden of alignment on senior level

### One/multi site distributed teams : with local satellite workers

Before COVID I saw this model being used more and more. It was especially prevalent in the US, where distances between cities are greater and people are opting to work and reside in places where the cost of living is lower and quality of life is higher - roughly one to three hours away from the main office.
In this model employees will spend between 60-90% of their time working remotely at a ‘commutable’ distance and travel in to the office only for ‘facetime’ at important meetings and cultural events. Although good in principle, this model can get tricky when the satellite workers are part of on-site distributed teams. I have often seen local satellite workers tend to become ‘second class team members’ due to their ‘disadvantage’ of being remote and getting ‘out-of-the-loop’ because of the high-bandwidth communication that occurs with the co-located team. This can be remedied to a certain extent by a strong on boarding process, regular facetime visits to the office and a strict adherences to a team charter but this needs requires extra effort from the team and the satellite worker to make it work.

#### Pros
* Higher quality of life for employees
* Marginally reduced salary costs
* Reduced commuter traffic

#### Cons
* Potentially ‘second class team members’ requiring extra overhead to keep ‘in-the-loop’

### One/multi site distributed teams : with distant satellite workers

Before COVID I saw this model being used more overall, as employees would often join companies from another country or continent and then when they decided to return the company would continue to employ them remotely rather than find a local replacement. The benefits for the company are potentially lower salary overheads and lower churn and loss of critical domain knowledge or skills and greater continuity. However, the ‘second class team member’ syndrome becomes even more pronounced here especially with different timezones. I tend to think this option is a panacea that has greater downsides in the long term unless it is used sparingly.

#### Pros
* Employees from other countries and live remotely with family in own culture
* Potentially reduced salary costs
* Reduced churn & loss of skills & domain knowledge
* Great business continuity

#### Cons
* ‘Second class team members’ require extra overhead to keep ‘in-the-loop’
* Timezones make it hard to schedule team meetings
* In-team communication has greater lag in response time &. Slower delivery
* Teams have the worst of both worlds, with remote overhead & limited co-located flexibility

### One/multi site distributed teams with offshore/nearshore support teams split horizontally by discipline

This model has a bad reputation, and maybe rightly so. In this set-up a cross-functional team may be split up so one part of the team is onsite and the other off-shore for example : the ‘creative’ part of the team is on-site in the HQ and the developers are off-shore in another delivery centre. 
The teams are often split across lines such as creativity/strategy/project management/front-end development/backend development/devOps with different groups tending to be bundled in locations like creativity/strategy/project management/front-end development at HQ and backend development/devOps off-shore. 
Honestly, I’ve mostly never seen this work well. 
With quite a lot of effort up-front to bring the whole team together to bond at the start of the project I’ve seen it functional but it takes a lot of effort and a lot of waste in terms of handovers. One of the few positives of this method, I have seen instances where the ‘noise’ from the parent organisation was so intrusive to development, that having a sheltered the off-shore team gave them room to get stuff done, but at best this is failure demand and solving the main problem would be a better solution.
Overall it’s much easier to take a bonded team and split them geographically by discipline than it is to take a number of disciplines who have never met, might have different cultures and try and get them to bond remotely.

#### Pros
* Can be a useful for teams if there is a lot of noise/thrashing/variability/chaos in HQ that prevents people getting things done.

#### Cons

* Misunderstandings & friction cross-site are common occurrence
* Remote disciplines usually become out-group to onsite team
* Handovers are very wasteful & often result in wrong work being done 
* Expectations often get garbled in communication transit
* You need people at the HQ who’s main job is to be a conduit between all the remote disciplines and HQ
* High travel costs involved in creating regular full-team meetings

### One/multi site distributed teams with offshore/nearshore support teams using a counterpart model

In this model either the whole team, or the key leadership functions of a team have counterparts in an off/near-shore team. So it can be that only the Product owner and technical lead have remote counterparts that manage the rest of a remote team, or it can be that the entire onsite team has a remote counterpart to support his or her work.
I can’t say I’m a fan of this model either I’m afraid. It usually results in the off-shore teams doing ‘grunt’ work or the parts of work that the on-site team don’t want to do essentially becoming the modern equivalent of a digital secretary.
Also the number of times I’ve seen automated testing pushed to the off-shore team is criminal not only because it totally negates one of the main benefits of developers writing tests but it also results in the feeling that the remote team can only handle ‘non-critical’ work.

#### Pros

* If teams have long-lived remote counterparts and have a lot of tasks that can be easily separated then it can help them deliver faster.

#### Cons

* Huge time waste in handovers
* Counterparts end up as secretaries
* Counterparts get a really bad experience
* It can lead to bad practices where on-site team members attempt to off-load parts of work they don’t enjoy
* If work can not easily be separated then arbitrary boundaries will be created which will actually make things take longer
* Remote workers often have nothing to do


### One/multi site distributed teams with offshore/nearshore delivery teams split vertically by feature/domain

This model is generally known as the solution to the horizontal model mentioned above. Instead of splitting the team by discipline, you keep the team delivery disciplines together at one site, so they can collaborate. The interface to the rest of the organisation is then implemented at the product level. Essentially meaning that the team is almost autonomous in its delivery with the strategic product/feature/domain ownership coming from HQ. Everything else from organisation to implementation is in the control of the remote team. As long as the HQ is organised enough, I’ve seen this model actually working pretty well. The difference between this model and the multi-site co-located teams is that often the product owner or strategic stakeholder will pre-dominantly be based at HQ to manage the business regularly flying out to meet the off/near shore team.

#### Pros

* Minimal waste from handovers
* High level of focus for delivery team
* Potential cost savings in salaries

#### Cons
* Risk of ‘build the wrong thing’ in handover between PO to the delivery team
* Extra effort needed to make sure delivery team has wider Org context
* Fiscal & emotional cost of PO/stakeholder regularly flying out to meet remote delivery team
* Offshore team churn can be higher than onsite
* Challenge to propagate company culture to remote locations

### Remote outsourced teams

So this is the joker of the pack. Does it really belong here? Maybe not, but there are some interesting features of Remote fully outsourced teams that are worth drawing attention too. In fact as remote teams get more and more common in organisations you may see them adopt some of the practices of remote fully outsourced teams. The things I'm talking about are around the practices and interfaces of remote outsourced teams. With other kinds of 'internal' remote teams, often the team will be subject to existing internal delivery processes, deployment processes, monitoring & alerting and maintanence practices that may not actually be loosely coupled to the code base. This results in those teams having the same constraits as internal teams and running at the same pace. With fully outsourced remote teams, often contractually or legally those kind of tight couplings and subtle control mechanisms are not allowed to specified, only the deliverable - leaving the outsourced team to innovate in ways of delivery as long as they provide the required artifact : code/container/library/api. The downside of course is that if you don't choose a good outsourced team, you may end up with terrible quality software.

#### Pros
* Hard artifact requirements - code/container/library/apis
* Isolated outcome based delivery practices - free from organisational latency
* Potential to use a test lab for new ideas which can then be folded back into regular teams

#### Cons
* Risk of bad quality deliveries 
* Extra effort needed to verifiy that outsource partners are high quality

### Internal remote first synchronous teams

So with remote first teams there are two main operating workflows that start to emerge, synchronous and asynchronous. With synchronous teams, although the team is physically separated, they work and communicate in a synchronous way. They start and end the day at roughly the same times, take breaks at the same times and as the work flows round the team, they pass it to each other in a way where they are foccused on getting the work through the queues and out the other end. Most importantly they work as a team and wait for things to be finished before starting more work. The benefits of this is that we don't accidently get lots of work-in-progress and that a lot of the things that we know create good flow in co-located teams can be adopted virtually, things like remote pairing, remote stand-ups, plannings, demo's and retros can all be done together as a team using remote tools like Miro.

#### Pros

* Less accidental WIP & more focussed work finished
* Team can take advantage of practices like remote pairing & online meetings
* Members feels more connected and bond better as a team 

#### Cons
* Harder for team members with variable schedules (parents who need to work when kids are asleep or pick up kids from schools) 
* Harder for team members in geographically diverse timezones
* Requires team to learn upskill in things like remote-paring & meeting culture

### Internal remote first asynchronous teams

At the opposite end of the spectum of remote teams you see a remote first aynchronous team. This type of team operates in a very parrallel way from each other, interfacing and syncing only when neccesary and being as autonomous as possible. Comminication happens asynchronously using message busses like slack and email are used heavily to deliver and recieve messages whenever team members come online.

#### Pros

* Great for team members with variable schedules (parents who need to work when kids are asleep or pick up kids from schools)
* Works well with team members who are in geographically diverse timezones
* Low investment needed to teach team members remote working skills 

#### Cons
* Risk of explosive WIP 
* Team members often gets stuck waiting for information from other team members
* Work gets stuck in queue's waiting for other team members to pick it up
* Progress of work & blockages becomes more opaque
* Larger investment in documentation required to try to avoid situations where people are off-line
* Work can be unpredictable and frustrating due to missing dependencies and lack of flow

### Internal remote first async & sync teams

This is where most remote-first teams find themselves, with a mixture of both async & sync communications and practices. This is probably the best option, trying to get the best of both worlds. What's super important in this scenario is that a team charter is created to make explicit the different async and sync workflows and communications in order to avoid some of the downsides of parrallel work. All in all if it's managed and behaviours are explicit then this is probably the most powerful remote model, if badly managed with opaque norms then this model also descendings into difficulties.

#### Pros




#### Cons
